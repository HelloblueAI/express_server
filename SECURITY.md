### **Reporting a Vulnerability**

We take security seriously. If you have discovered a potential security vulnerability, we **strongly encourage** you to report it **privately and responsibly** so we can address it promptly.

#### **How to Report**

*    **Email:** security@helloblue.ai
*    **PGP Key (Optional for Encryption):** [Download Here](#)
*    **Report via GitHub Security Advisory:** [Submit Here](https://github.com/HelloblueAI/hbLab-B01/security/advisories)


⛔ **Do NOT disclose security issues publicly** before we have had a chance to investigate and deploy a fix.

### **⏳ Response & Resolution Process**

Once a report is received, we follow a structured response process:

1.  **Initial Acknowledgment (Within 48 Hours)**

    *   We confirm receipt of your report.
    *   We may ask for **additional details** or proof of concept (PoC).

2.  **Investigation & Risk Assessment**

    *   Our security team will **reproduce** the issue and evaluate its severity.
    *   If valid, we prioritize it based on impact.

3.  **Fix Development & Testing**

    *   A security patch will be developed, reviewed, and tested.
    *   Where necessary, we coordinate **responsible disclosure** timelines with the reporter.

4.  **Deployment & Public Disclosure**
    *   The fix is rolled out via **a security update.**
    *   We may publish a **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifier** if applicable.
    *   The issue may be **acknowledged in release notes** (if the reporter consents).

### ** Acknowledgment & Recognition**
We value security researchers who help us keep our platform safe. If you responsibly disclose a vulnerability, you may be **publicly credited** for your findings (if you wish).Additionally, high-impact vulnerabilities may qualify for **Hall of Fame recognition** or **future collaboration opportunities.** 🎖️

**Responsible Disclosure Rewards** (non-monetary) may include:✔️ **Special Mention in Release Notes**✔️ **LinkedIn or GitHub Recognition**✔️ **Early Access to Security Previews**

### **Guidelines for Responsible Disclosure**

To ensure a smooth and productive process, please:✅ Provide **detailed steps, PoC (Proof of Concept), and impact analysis**.✅ Allow us a **reasonable timeframe** to address the issue before public disclosure.✅ Avoid using **automated scanners or brute force attacks** to find vulnerabilities.✅ Do not exploit a vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the risk.

### **🚫 Out of Scope Reports**

🔹 **Non-Exploitable Vulnerabilities** (e.g., lack of X-Frame-Options in non-sensitive pages).🔹 **Self-XSS (Reflected only to the attacker)**🔹 **Denial of Service (DoS) via Rate Limiting**🔹 **Reports involving outdated browsers/plugins** not in mainstream use.🔹 **Spamming, Phishing, or Social Engineering attacks.**
