## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of our project is a top priority. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our application, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will do our best to address it as quickly as possible.

### Contact

Please report security vulnerabilities by contacting us directly at security@helloblue.ai. Avoid disclosing them publicly until they have been resolved.

### Response

After reporting a vulnerability, you can expect the following response from us:

- **Initial response within 48 hours**: We will acknowledge your report and outline the next steps.
- **Investigation**: Our team will investigate the issue and determine the required actions.
- **Resolution and follow-up**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work closely with you to resolve it and communicate updates regularly.

### Acknowledgment

Once a significant vulnerability has been resolved, we will publicly acknowledge it in our project updates. Contributors who report valid issues may be credited for their efforts, unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

## What to Expect After Reporting

- **Acceptance**: If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work with you to understand its scope and impact to develop an effective fix.
- **Declination**: If the report is declined, we will provide reasons why it does not meet our criteria as a security vulnerability.

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are appreciated. Your help is invaluable in keeping our project and its users safe.
